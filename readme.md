## About

These are my first steps in Java and Springboot, a simple web application that returns the HTTP-Request-Headers as JSON.
I use it mostly as a test application for deployments, CI/CD and connectivity analysis.

## Requirements

- java 17
- maven

## Install

- Clone repo and run `./mvnw spring-boot:run`
